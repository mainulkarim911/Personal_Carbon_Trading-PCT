# Personal_Carbon_Trading-PCT

Personal Carbon Trading (PCT) is a proposed emissions trading scheme under which emissions credits would be allocated to adult individuals on a (broadly) equal per capita basis, within national carbon budgets. Individuals would then surrender these credits when buying fuel or electricity. Those who want or need to emit at a level above that permitted by their initial allocation would be able to purchase additional credits in the personal carbon market from those using less, creating a profit for those individuals who emit at a level below that permitted by their initial allocation. PCT is a radical approach to reducing emissions from energy use in the residential sector. It focuses on individual energy users and locates rights and responsibilities with individuals for their carbon emissions from household energy use and/or personal travel. It has the potential to mitigate environmental impact and foster sustainability. ðŸ˜Š
